# Predicting your Airbnb Listing Price
## Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Airbnb Project

**This is an analysis from Boston and Seattle's Airbnb data. The project's objective was to answer 3 questions using data analysis and modelling techniques. My findings can also be found in a medium article here:** link here

### Used Frameworks <a name="frameworks"></a>
The project was implemented with Anaconda's distribution of Python 3.9. The used frameworks are the following:
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib (version 3.5)
4. Seaborn
5. String 
6. Warnings
7. Scikit-Learn 

### Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
After taking a look at the data, I wanted to to understand what are the main variables that can affect your listing's price and review scores. I also wanted to compare Seattle's listings with Boston's in order to check if there was a overall better city when it comes to Airbnb listings. The three questions were:

1. Which city has the best listings? Which one has more expensive ones? Is there a connection in that?
2. What's the connection between price and occupation rate? Where does the quality of the listing fits in that?
3. What are the main features that influences the review rates? What about the prices?

### File Descriptions<a name='files'></a>

- There are two data folders: 'Seattle' and 'Boston'. In there you can find the 6 datasets. 
- The jupyter notebook contains the entire project code that follows the CRISP-DM process, as well as markdown cells for documentation.
